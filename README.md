# [Project 1: Tool for options trading to support decision making: Project overview:](https://github.com/JJuvakka/Financial_analytics)
* Simulated S&P 500 prices and returns as a random walk with drift
* Calculated theoretical probability for profit and expected outcome for short vertical call spread
* Simulated different portfoliovalues for an optionsportfolio
* Calculated expected portfoliovalue, expected annual return and probabilities for the portfoliovalue to drop 50 % or 100 %.
* Plotted simulated portfoliovalues with line- and histogram plots
* Critique: Tool is simplified model and the most importand parameter volatility has to still be estimated

# [Project 2: Analysis on used cars sales data: Project overview:](https://github.com/JJuvakka/Data_science_excel_projects)
* Dowloaded the data from Kaggle to find out the most common used car brand and fuel type in Germany
* Cleaned and filtered data
* Made pivot tables and figures to illustrate the findings
* Run a linear regression to find out the depreciation of used Volkswagen Golf cars
* Critique: Price data is asking prices which probably makes the regression to overestimate the values
